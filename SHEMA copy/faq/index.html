              <p class="h3-card-subtitle">
                The Bible was written within the culture of ancient Israel.
                Knowing that heritage reveals nuances and connections that
                strengthen faith today.

              <p class="h3-card-subtitle">
                Yes. SHEMA explores insights from Genesis through Revelation,
                connecting both Testaments through their shared Jewish roots.
