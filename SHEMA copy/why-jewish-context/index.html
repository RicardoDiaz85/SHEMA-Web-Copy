            <p class="h2-subtitle">
              The Bible wasn’t written in a cultural vacuum. Every verse is
              shaped by ancient Jewish life, language, and worldview. When we
              rediscover Scripture through its original context, familiar
              stories gain new meaning, and Jesus’ teachings come alive in
              unexpected ways. SHEMA helps you see the Bible as its first
              hearers did—so you don’t miss what Western eyes often overlook.

              Most Bible readers miss this beauty because we filter Scripture

                  Many Christians read an Eastern book through Western

                  Without that framework, Jesus' radical love and teaching can
                  feel flat, or even distorted.

                is referring to.
